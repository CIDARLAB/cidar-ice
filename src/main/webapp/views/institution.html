    The Cross-disciplinary Integration of Design Automation Research (CIDAR) laboratory at Boston University brings together diverse areas of synthetic biology research, including microbial engineering, computer-aided design (CAD) and automation, and single-cell analyses. CIDAR is composed of a diverse team of undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, and research staff from a range of programming, engineering and scientific backgrounds.

    This repository of biological data represents CIDAR's efforts to disseminate information rapidly to be used in a variety of external research projects. A key goal of this repository is to enable the large scale bio-design automation efforts of researchers interested in computational methods to enhance the speed, quality, and cost effectiveness of synthetic biology.
