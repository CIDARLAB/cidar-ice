    The mission of the Biological Design Center is to rigorously understand lifeâ€™s design principles and re-engineer them to revolutionize our approach to addressing critical challenges in human health and the environment. The BDC fosters unconventional mixing and matching of disparate research areas within a highly collaborative and team-driven environment to create disruptive ideas and technologies.
    <br><br>
    This repository of biological data represents BDC's efforts to disseminate information rapidly to be used in a variety of external research projects. A key goal of this repository is to enable the large scale bio-design automation efforts of researchers interested in computational methods to enhance the speed, quality, and cost effectiveness of synthetic biology.
