    The Cross-disciplinary Integration of Design Automation Research (CIDAR) laboratory at Boston University brings together diverse areas of synthetic biology research, including microbial engineering, computer-aided design (CAD) and automation, and single-cell analyses. CIDAR is composed of a diverse team of undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, and research staff from a range of programming, engineering and scientific backgrounds.
    <br><br>
    This repository of biological data represents CIDAR's efforts to disseminate information rapidly to be used in a variety of external research projects. A key goal of this repository is to enable the large scale bio-design automation efforts of researchers interested in computational methods to enhance the speed, quality, and cost effectiveness of synthetic biology.

    The <a href="http://www.jbei.org"
           target="_blank">Joint BioEnergy Institute</a>'s Inventory of Composable Elements (ICE) is an
    open source registry software and platform for managing information about biological parts.
    It is capable of recording  information about “legacy” parts such as plasmids,
    microbial host strains, and <i>Arabidopsis</i> seeds.

    <br><br>
    ICE is built upon the idea of a Web of Registries, and thus provides strong
    support for distributed, interconnected use. It includes several useful
    graphical applications for sequence annotation, manipulation and analysis.
